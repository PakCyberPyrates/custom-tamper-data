<h5>To Do</h5>
<p>A list of things I'd like to add or change.</p>

<br>
   <li>Scroll bars in list boxes.  It shouldn't be this hard.</li>
<br>
<br>
   <li>Cache hit detection.  Currently these request are just listed as pending. <br>
<em>- the problem here is that the response observer doesn't get called when we read 
from the cache, and the cache doesn't seem to expose any notification when it's read from</em></li>
<br>
<br>
   <li>Change more of the list boxes into trees to avoid resize effects</li>
<br>
<br>
   <li><strike>Decode/encode check box on detail pop up - so some of the entries are more readable</strike> - done in v0.50</li>
<br>
<br>
   <li>Different pop up for cookies?  Might make it easier to show more details.</li>
<br>
<br>
   <li><strike>Add request to title bar of tamper pop up.</strike> - done in v0.40</li>
<br>
<br>
   <li>Better abort.  As I understand it, the way I've implemented abort (using cancel) doesn't really stop the request,
but rather throws out the response.  This is not ideal...</li>
<br>
<br>
   <li>Refactoring.</li>
<ul>
